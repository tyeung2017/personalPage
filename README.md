# My Personal Page

## Background
+ Inspired by Emily Xie in CodingTrain Youtube channel (source : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1TQCi9axzg&t=1s), it would be cool to incorporate the Matrix rain effect into my personal page. 

+ However, instead of using her Array of streams approach, I used a 'there is no streams' approach, as this echoes the **'there is no spoon'** theme in the Matrix trilogy.

## Features
+ This is supposed to be a simple one page website with two links. 

+ No external libraries are used in this project; Only vanilla Javascript is used

+ Repsonsive design with high mobile device compatibility; the page would render different results according to the screen size

+ Fun Fact:
  + Falling characters in this page consist of Chinese, English, Japanese and numbers, and I can speak those languages :smile:
    Original Matrix rain consisted of mainly Japanese katakana and numbers.
    
  + My English name is somehow related to the trilogy. But that is for another story.
    
## Stretch Goal
+ CNAME with my own Domain name
+ solve pending issues listed in Issues
+ expand this to a full fledge SPA feature all past projects :question:
+ reactify this when expanding this :thinking:
